# Frontend Developer Task

## Few simple steps

1. Fork this repo
2. Prepare pull request and let us know that you are done

## Few simple requirements

- Design should be recreated as closely as possible.
- Design must be responsive. Because we live in our smartphones and we will check with them for sure.
- Use CSS preprocessor (SCSS preferred).
- Browser support must be great. All modern browsers plus IE9 and above.
- Use a Javascript task-runner. Webpack, Grunt or Gulp - it doesn't matter.
- Do not commit the build, because we are building things on deployment.
- VueJS, AngularJS or ReactJS would be an advantage

## Few tips

- Structure!
- Have fun!
- Hosted DEMO would give some extra points
